# Homework 2 Directions 

Find 2 different data sets and compute summary statistics.

For each data set try to answer the following questions:

- How many columns are there?
- How many rows are there?
- Are the columns numerical, categorical, or both?
- Are there columns that provide no information? Just constant or unique values for all observations.
- For each categorical columns compute the mode.
- For each numerical column compute the mean (average), max, and min values.
Plot histograms for numerical columns -- comment on the distribution (normal, multi-modal etc)
- Plot bar plots for categorical columns. -- comment on whether the data set is balanced in terms of the representation of the various labels in the categorical columns.
